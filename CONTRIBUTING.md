# Contribution Rules
There are some simple rules that everyone should follow:

### Do not commit files from build folder
> I usually have horrible merge conflicts when I upload the build version that take me too much time to solve, but I want to keep the build version in the repo, so I guess it would be better if only one of us does the built, which would be me.

Those files will be updated by owner.
